Internet-Draft      OAuth Dynamic Client Registration        August 2010


1.  Introduction

   In some use-case scenarios it is desirable or necessary to allow
   OAuth clients to obtain authorization from an OAuth authorization
   server without the two parties having previously interacted.
   Nevertheless, in order for the authorization server to accurately
   represent to end-users which client is seeking authorization to
   access the end-user's resources, a method for automatic and unique
   registration of clients is needed.

   The goal of this proposed registration protocol is for an
   authorization server to provide a client with a client identifier and
   optionally a client secret in a dynamic fashion.  To accomplish this,
   the authorization server must first be provided with information
   about the client, with the client-name being the minimal information
   provided.  In practice, additional information will need to be
   furnished to the authorization server, such as the client's homepage,
   icon, description, and so on.

   The dynamic registration protocol proposed here is envisioned to be
   an additional task to be performed by the OAuth authorization server,
   namely registration of a new client identifier and optional secret,
   and the issuance of this information to the client.  This task would
   occur prior to the point at which the client wields its identifier
   and secret at the authorization server in order to obtain an access
   token in normal OAuth fashion.

   This informal draft discusses a number of requirements for and
   approaches to automatic registration of clients to the OAuth
   authorization server, with special emphasis on the needs of the
   OAuth-based User-Managed Access protocol [[provide citation]].

1.2.  Terminology

   resource server
         A server capable of accepting and responding to protected
         resource requests.

   resource owner
         An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.

   client
         An application obtaining authorization and making protected
         resource requests.

   authorization server
         A server capable of issuing tokens after successfully
         authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
         The authorization server may be the same server as the resource
         server, or a separate entity.

   authorization manager
         An UMA-defined variant of an authorization server that carries
         out an authorizing user's policies governing access to a
         protected resource.

   end-user authorization endpoint
         The authorization server's HTTP endpoint capable of
         authenticating the end-user and obtaining authorization.

   token endpoint
         The authorization server's HTTP endpoint capable of issuing
         tokens and refreshing expired tokens.

   client identifier
         An unique identifier issued to the client to identify itself to
         the authorization server.  Client identifiers may have a
         matching secret.

   client registration endpoint  The authorization server's HTTP
         endpoint capable of issuing client identifiers and optional
         client secrets.


2.  Requirements

   In addition to the following general requirements for dynamic client
   registration, the User-Managed Access (UMA) protocol seeks to
   optimize for the design principles and requirements found in the UMA
   Requirements document [[provide citation]], for example:

      DP1: Simple to understand, implement in an interoperable fashion,
      and deploy on an Internet-wide scale

      DP6: Able to be combined and extended to support a variety of use
      cases and emerging application functionality.

      DP8: Avoid adding crypto requirements beyond what existing web app
      implementations do today.

      DP10: Complexity should be borne by the authorization endpoint vs.
      other endpoints.

2.1.  The client needs to be uniquely identifiable by the authorization
      server

   In order for an authorization server to do proper user-delegated
   authorization and prevent unauthorized access it must be able to
   identify clients uniquely.  As is done today in OAuth, the client
   identifier (and optional secret) should thus be issued by the
   authorization server and not simply accepted as proposed by the
   client.

2.2.  The authorization server must be able to retrieve metadata about a
      client for later user interaction

   In order for the authorization server to describe a client to the
   end-user in an authorization step it needs information about the
   client.  This can be the client name at a minimum, but today servers
   usually request at least a description, a homepage URL, and an icon
   when doing manual registration.

2.3.  The authorization server must have the option of strongly
      authenticating the client and its metadata

   In order to prevent spoofing of clients, the authorization server
   should have the option to verify the provided information.  This
   might be solved using signature verification; relatively weaker
   authentication might be achieved in a simpler way by pulling metadata
   from a trusted client URL.

2.4.  Dynamic client registration must be possible from both web-server
      applications and native applications

   Native applications on (e.g.) mobile devices have special
   limitations, so alternative solutions to meeting this set of
   requirements must be sought.

   In the UMA context, one type of dynamic client registration may be in

Internet-Draft      OAuth Dynamic Client Registration        August 2010


   a sub-process of a larger process where a requester (an enhanced type
   of OAuth client) approaches an authorization manager (an enhanced
   type of OAuth authorization server), without having interacted
   before, seeking an access token.  The requester may be any kind of
   OAuth client; we anticipate that web servers and native applications
   are the most important kinds of client for which a dynamic
   registration solution will be sought.

2.5.  Transaction integrity must be ensured in large deployments where
      data propagation can be an issue

   When a client sends information to a server endpoint, it might take
   time for this data to propagate through big server installations that
   spread across various data centers.  Care needs to be taken that
   subsequent interactions with the user after the registration process,
   such as an authorization request, show the correct data.

   In the UMA context, one type of dynamic client registration may be in
   a sub-process of a larger process where an authorizing user (an
   enhanced role for an OAuth end-user) introduces a host (an enhanced
   type of OAuth resource server) to an authorization manager (an
   enhanced type of OAuth authorization server) as a client of it.  If
   this host has never "met" this authorization manager before, it must
   obtain a unique identifier to use there.  Even though such an
   identifier is needed no matter which end-user caused the registration
   process to take place, the end-user may need to wait for the sub-
   process to finish in order to continue with the introduction and
   policy configuration process.


3.  Analysis of Registration Flow Options

   There are different approaches one can take to exchange client
   metadata for a client identifier and optional secret.

   1.  Providing client metadata on every request and not using a client
       identifier at all: In this approach all necessary client
       information like client_name or client_icon is passed on every
       request to the authorization server to display it to the user if
       necessary.  This option makes it more difficult to meet the first
       and second requirements since different clients could
       theoretically represent themselves to an authorization server
       with the same metadata and the same client could represent itself
       on subsequent visits with different metadata.  Also, today's
       OAuth protocol requires the use of a client identifier.  Because
       of the UMA simplicity principle we do not recommend this flow
       option and and have not provided a candidate solution.

Internet-Draft      OAuth Dynamic Client Registration        August 2010


   2.  The client "pushes" its metadata to the authorization server,
       which returns the client identification information: In this
       approach the client discovers the registration endpoint of the
       authorization server and sends its metadata to that endpoint in
       (e.g.)  JSON format.  The authorization server answers with a
       client identifier and optional secret in the response.  This
       approach may be necessary in cases where the client is behind a
       firewall, but may have difficulty meeting the propagation
       requirement, since the metadata might be sent to a server far
       away from the server the end-user subsequently interacts with.
       Strong authentication of the client metadata is more difficult
       with this approach than with the next one, though not impossible.
       Further, this approach is problematic in the case of native
       applications that can't function as web servers.

   3.  The authorization server "pulls" client metadata and returns
       client identification information: In this approach the client
       sends only a URL to the authorization server, which then uses
       that information to pull metadata about the client, e.g. via XRD,
       and returns identification information in the response to the
       initial request.  This approach most easily allows for strong
       authentication of clients but still does not entirely solve the
       propagation issue, as the initial URL push may be made to a
       server different from the one the end-user is interacting with.

   It seems impossible to specify a single registration flow that will
   satisfy all requirements, deployment needs, and client types.  This
   document, therefore, presents as small a variety of options as
   possible, organized according to client capabilities much as OAuth's
   client profiles are.


4.  Discovery of client registration endpoint

   Regardless of flow option, the client needs to discover the
   authorization server's client registration endpoint.

   The client MUST use the [RFC5785] and [I-D.hammer-hostmeta] discovery
   mechanisms to learn about the URI of the client registration endpoint
   at the authorization server at which the client wants to register.
   The authorization server MUST provide a host-meta document containing
   a Link element with a rel value of:
   "http://oauth.net/as/registration"

   For example:


         <XRD>
           <Host>http://server.example.com</Host>
           <Link rel="http://oauth.net/as/registration"
                 href="https://server.example.com/register">
               <Title>Client Registration Endpoint</Title>
           </Link>
         </XRD>



5.  Client Registration with Pushed Metadata

5.1.  Overview

   This registration flow is intended only for clients that do not
   support having an authorization server pull metadata from them, for
   example, web-server clients behind a firewall.  It works as follows:

   1.  The client sends metadata to the client registration endpoint.
       The client MUST send its name, description, and redirection URI
       and MAY send a URI to its icon.  The client MAY sign the
       metadata.

   2.  The authorization server checks the data (verifying the signature
       as necessary) and returns a client identifier and an optional
       client secret.



     +--------+                                  +---------------+
     | Client |--(A)--- Registration Request --->| Authorization |
     |        |         with Metadata            |     Server    |
     |        |                                  |               |
     |        |<-(B)----Registration Response ---|               |
     |        |         with Client ID Info      |               |
     +--------+                                  +---------------+

5.2.  Client Registration Request

   The client sends a JSON formatted document to the client registration
   endpoint.  The client includes the following parameters in the
   request:

   type
         REQUIRED.  This parameter must be set to "push".

   client_name
         REQUIRED.  This field must contain the human-readable name of
         the client.

   client_url
         REQUIRED.  This field contains the URL of the homepage of the
         client.

   client_desc
         REQUIRED.  This field must contain the description of the
         client.

   client_icon
         OPTIONAL.  If given, this field contains a URL to an icon for
         the client.

   redirect_url
         REQUIRED.  This field contains the URL to which the
         authorization server should send its response.  [[Must it use
         https?]]

   The client MAY include additional metadata in the request and the
   authorization server MAY ignore this additional information.

   [[Say something about how to sign the metadata, and how it can be
   verified.]]

   For example, the client might send the following request:


    POST /register HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      type: "push",
      client_name: "Online Photo Gallery",
      client_url:  "http://onlinephotogallery.com",
      client_desc: "Not only uploading, but also editing capabilities!",
      client_icon: "http://onlinephotogallery.com/icon.png",
      redirect_url: "https://onlinephotogallery.com/client_reg"
    }

Internet-Draft      OAuth Dynamic Client Registration        August 2010


   The parameters are included in the entity body of the HTTP request
   using the "application/json" media type as defined by [RFC4627].  The
   parameters are serialized into a JSON structure by adding each
   parameter at the highest structure level.  Parameter names and string
   values are included as JSON strings.

5.3.  Client Registration Response

   After receiving and verifying information received from the client,
   the authorization server issues the client identifier and an optional
   client secret, and constructs the response by adding the following
   parameters to the entity body of the HTTP response with a 200 status
   code (OK):

   client_id
         REQUIRED.

   client_secret
         OPTIONAL.

   issued_at
         OPTIONAL.  Specifies the timestamp when the identifier was
         issued.  The timestamp value MUST be a positive integer.  The
         value is expressed in the number of seconds since January 1,
         1970 00:00:00 GMT.

   expires_in
         OPTIONAL; if supplied, the "issued_at" parameter is REQUIRED.
         Specifies the valid lifetime, in seconds, of the identifier.
         The value is represented in base 10 ASCII.

   The parameters are included in the entity body of the HTTP response
   using the "application/json" media type as defined by [RFC4627].  The
   parameters are serialized into a JSON structure by adding each
   parameter at the highest structure level.  Parameter names and string
   values are included as JSON strings.

   The authorization server MUST include the HTTP "Cache-Control"
   response header field with a value of "no-store" in any response
   containing "client_secret".

Internet-Draft      OAuth Dynamic Client Registration        August 2010


   For example, the authorization server might return the following
   response:


       HTTP/1.1 200 OK
       Content-Type: application/json
       Cache-Control: no-store

       {
         client_id: "5UO9XcL4TQTa",
         client_secret: "WdRKN3zeTc20"
       }


5.4.  Error Message

   If the request for registration is invalid or unauthorized, the
   authorization server constructs the response by adding the following
   parameters to the entity body of the HTTP response with a 400 status
   code (Bad Request) using the "application/json" media type:

   o  "error" (REQUIRED)

   o  "description" (OPTIONAL)

   An example error response (with line breaks for readability)


       HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
       Content-Type: application/json
       Cache-Control: no-store

       {
       "error": "unauthorized_client",
       "description": "This client is not on the
         white list of this Authorization Server"
       }



6.  Client Registration with Pulled Metadata

6.1.  Overview

   This registration flow is intended generally for most clients, which
   are expected to support having an authorization server pull metadata
   from them, for example, web-server clients that are not behind a
   firewall, and instances of native-app clients that have a server-side

   application that functions as a "registration proxy" for them.  It
   works as follows:

   1.  The client sends its metadata URI to the client registration
       endpoint

   2.  The authorization server uses the [RFC5785] and
       [I-D.hammer-hostmeta] discovery mechanisms on this URI to
       retrieve the host-meta document describing the client.  The host-
       meta document MUST contain the client's name, description, and
       redirection URI, and MAY contain a URI to the client's icon.

          Figure 2: Client Registration Flow with Pulled Metadata

6.2.  Client Registration Request

   The client sends a JSON formatted document to the client registration
   endpoint.  The client includes the following parameters in the
   request:

   type
         REQUIRED.  This parameter must be set to "pull".

   client_url
         REQUIRED.  This field contains the URL of the homepage of the
         client.

   The client MUST NOT include other metadata parameters, such as those
   defined in the pushed-metadata scenario.  [[Correct?  Need error
   condition for this?]]

Internet-Draft      OAuth Dynamic Client Registration        August 2010


   For example, the client might send the following request:


       POST /register HTTP/1.1
       Host: server.example.com
       Content-Type: application/json

       {
         type: "pull",
         url: "http://onlinephotogallery.com"
       }



   The parameters are included in the entity body of the HTTP request
   using the "application/json" media type as defined by [RFC4627].  The
   parameters are serialized into a JSON structure by adding each
   parameter at the highest structure level.  Parameter names and string
   values are included as JSON strings.

6.3.  Client Discovery

   The authorization server evaluates this request and MAY perform a
   [RFC5785] and [I-D.hammer-hostmeta] discovery mechanism on the
   provided URL to the host-meta document for the client.

   For example:


       GET /.well-known/host-meta HTTP/1.1
       Host: server.example.com


   The authorization server retrieves the host-meta document, which MUST
   contain:

   o  A "Property" element with a "type" value of
      "http://oauth.net/client/name" containing the human-readable
      client name.  (REQUIRED)

   o  A "Property" element with a "type" value of
      "http://oauth.net/client/description" containing the human
      readable description of the client.  (REQUIRED)

   o  A "Link" element with a "rel" value of
      "http://oauth.net/client/redirect_uri" (REQUIRED).

Internet-Draft      OAuth Dynamic Client Registration        August 2010


   o  A "Link" element with a "rel" value of
      "http://oauth.net/client/uri" (REQUIRED).

   o  A "Link" element with a "rel" value of
      "http://oauth.net/client/icon" (REQUIRED).  [[Make OPTIONAL, as in
      the push case?]]

   For example:


       <XRD>
         <Host>http://onlinephotogallery.com</Host>
         <Property type="http://oauth.net/client/name">
           Online Photo Gallery
         </Property>
         <Property type="http://oauth.net/client/description">
           Not only uploading, but also editing capabilities!
         </Property>
         <Link rel="http://oauth.net/client/uri"
               href="http://onlinephotogallery.com">
           <Title>Client URI</Title>
         </Link>
         <Link rel="http://oauth.net/client/redirect_uri"
               href="https://onlinephotogallery.com/client_reg">
           <Title>Client Redirect URI</Title>
         </Link>
         <Link rel="http://oauth.net/client/icon"
               href="http://onlinephotogallery.com/icon.png">
           <Title>Client Icon</Title>
         </Link>
       </XRD>


6.4.  Client Registration Response

   After receiving and verifying information retrieved from the client,
   the authorization server issues the client identifier and an optional
   client secret, and constructs the response by adding the following
   parameters to the entity body of the HTTP response with a 200 status
   code (OK):

   o  "client_id" (REQUIRED)

   o  "client_secret" (OPTIONAL)

   The parameters are included in the entity body of the HTTP response
   using the "application/json" media type as defined by [RFC4627].  The
   parameters are serialized into a JSON structure by adding each

Internet-Draft      OAuth Dynamic Client Registration        August 2010


   parameter at the highest structure level.  Parameter names and string
   values are included as JSON strings.

   The authorization server MUST include the HTTP "Cache-Control"
   response header field with a value of "no-store" in any response
   containing the "client_secret".

   For example the authorization server might return the following
   response:


       HTTP/1.1 200 OK
       Content-Type: application/json
       Cache-Control: no-store

       {
         "client_id":"5UO9XcL4TQTa",
         "client_secret":"WdRKN3zeTc20"
       }


6.5.  Unsuccessful Client Discovery

   If the host-meta discovery was not successful, the authorization
   server constructs the response by adding the following parameters to
   the entity body of the HTTP response with a 404 status code (Not
   Found) using the "application/json" media type:

   o  "error" (REQUIRED).  This parameter must be set to
      "hostmeta_error"

   o  "description" (OPTIONAL)

   An example error response (with line breaks for readability)


       HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
       Content-Type: application/json
       Cache-Control: no-store

       {
       "error": "hostmeta_error",
       "description": "The hostmeta document could
           not have been retrieved from the URL."
       }

6.6.  Error Message

   If the request for registration is invalid or unauthorized, the
   authorization server constructs the response by adding the following
   parameters to the entity body of the HTTP response with a 400 status
   code (Bad Request) using the "application/json" media type:

   o  "error" (REQUIRED)

   o  "description" (OPTIONAL)

   An example error response (with line breaks for readability)


       HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
       Content-Type: application/json
       Cache-Control: no-store

       {
       "error": "unauthorized_client",
       "description": "This client is not on the
         white list of this Authorization Server"
       }



7.  Security Considerations

   [[TBS: Thomas has suggested we include the merits of pull over push
   and the vulnerabilities in the native-app scenario here.]]


Appendix A.  TODOs

   o  How would signing work in push and pull cases?

   o  How is the propagation requirement now solved?  Is this a problem
      at all?

   o  Add a type of "proxy_pull" for the native-app-initiated use case?

   o  Need to mention that in the push and pull cases the URL/metadata
      is being POSTed.  Also require that the registration endpoint uses
      HTTPS?
